# Splendor

This is an implementation of the board game Splendor.
###Major Parts of the Project
*Game Logic and Game Loop
*Graphic User Inferface
*Server and Client
*AI Mode
*Replay Mode

For now, the basic functions of the game were done and the networking part also works. Though the AI of the game is not smart enought, we may try more state-of-art learning methods to improve our AI.
